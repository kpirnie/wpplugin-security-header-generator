## Configuration

### Getting Started

3. Use the **Content Security Policy** tab to configure CSP directives
4. Check the **Documentation** tab for detailed guidance

### Content Security Policy Setup
Setting up CSP can be complex and requires careful attention:

1. **Initial Configuration**: Browse your website thoroughly and track all external resources
2. **Add Sources**: Include all legitimate sources in the plugin's CSP settings
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Save settings and test your site functionality
4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process multiple times to catch all resources
5. **Monitor**: Some external resources load their own dependencies that won't appear until parent resources are allowed

**Important**: CSP configuration may require multiple iterations. External resources like iframes, scripts, and stylesheets can pull in their own external dependencies that won't be visible until the parent items are properly configured.
